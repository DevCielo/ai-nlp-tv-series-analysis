# **TV Series Analysis with AI, LLMs, and NLP**
THIS IS STILL A WIP AND IS NOT FINISHED

## **Motivation**

The motivation behind this project is to explore how AI, large language models (LLMs), and natural language processing (NLP) can be applied to analyze a TV series. By gathering data, extracting themes, building character networks, and creating a chatbot to imitate characters, this project provides a comprehensive demonstration of NLP techniques on real-world entertainment data.

## **Why This Project?**

This project was built to show how modern AI techniques can enhance the understanding of TV series by analyzing key elements such as character relationships, themes, and interactions. Additionally, it allows for a unique interaction with characters through a custom chatbot that mimics their conversational styles.

## **Problem Solved**

The project solves the challenge of interpreting a TV series through the lens of AI, allowing for automated theme detection, character network visualization, and personalized interactions via chatbots. It enables viewers to gain deeper insights into their favorite series and interact with it in new ways.

## **What I Learned**

Throughout this project, I have learned:

- How to gather and scrape data from various sources using **Scrapy**.
- The basics of neural networks and how they evolved into **LLMs**.
- The process of using **Hugging Face** and **Transformers** for zero-shot classification and text analysis.
- How to create character networks and visualize relationships using **Spacy**’s Named Entity Recognition (NER) model and **NetworkX**.
- How to build a text classifier on a custom dataset.
- How to develop a chatbot to imitate characters using **Transformer** models.

## **What Makes This Project Stand Out**

- **Comprehensive Workflow**: The project encompasses multiple AI and NLP techniques, from data scraping to chatbot development, providing a holistic view of AI in entertainment analysis.
- **Character Networks**: Visualizes character importance and relationships within the series, offering unique insights into character dynamics.
- **Custom Chatbots**: Creates interactive bots that mimic your favorite characters, allowing fans to engage with the series in a new way.
- **Real-World Application**: Demonstrates how modern AI models like **Transformers** can be applied to cultural and media analysis.

## **Current Implementations**

- **Data Gathering**: Used **Scrapy** to collect subtitles and other relevant data from multiple sources.
- **Zero-Shot Classification**: Implemented a zero-shot text classifier using **Hugging Face** and **Transformers** to extract themes from the series.
- **Character Network**: Built a character network using **Spacy**’s NER model, **NetworkX**, and **Pyviz** to visualize relationships and character significance.
- **Text Classifier**: Trained a custom text classifier to categorize different aspects of the series.
- **Character Chatbot**: Created a chatbot that imitates series characters using **Hugging Face**’s Transformers.

## **Future Implementations**

- Further optimization of the chatbot for more natural and engaging interactions.
- Expanding the dataset to include more TV series for a broader analysis.
- Developing sentiment analysis to understand viewer responses to key moments in the series.
- Integrating additional NLP models for deeper thematic analysis.
